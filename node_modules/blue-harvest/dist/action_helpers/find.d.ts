 * Retrying Find does several things to improve stability for tests. Throws

 * true if the element was not desired and was not found.
 *
 * NOTE: We are attempting to deprecate all the extra retries here by hooking
 * Pantheon up to the standard task-based system that Protractor uses to ask
 * Angular when the page is stable.
 *
 * Current stability measures:
 *  - Polling retry until the timeout is hit.
 *  - Make sure the element is visible for two searches at least 0.5 seconds
 *    apart.
